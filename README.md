# ExhibitionBuilder
 The Exhibition Builder (ExBuilder) for digital art exhibitions made in Unity, presented by the Mackenzie Art Gallery
# How to use
##    The ExBuilder is an application made with Unity, a video game engine, that can be used as standalone software or alongside Unity.
##    The purpose is to make it easier for artists, curators, and galleries to assemble presentations of digital artworks, facilitating interactions with technicians working in Unity.
##    With the exhibition builder, digital artworks can be positioned within a space, that can be modified with objects like floors, walls, or other basic shapes. The space can then be experienced from a first person perspective.
##    To access the exported ExBuilder software, also known as a "build", go to https://spekwork.itch.io/exhibition-builder?secret=mmEMwcHrkpzQ7EIdK9S4vz8JAh0 - it can be downloaded for Windows or Mac.
# Adding Artworks
##    Some default artworks are included in the current exported build of the ExBuilder.
##    This github repository contains the complete Unity project, and can be used to add more artworks to the project.
##    In the Unity project, artworks are contained within the folders Assets/Resources/Objects and Assets/Resources/Primitives - placing more objects into those folders allows the users to place them in the built version of the project. 
##    You may have to select the item located at Assets/Resources/ResourceDB, and chose "Update."
##    Then, Build the application by going to File>Build Settings, choose the appropriate platform, and then press build.
